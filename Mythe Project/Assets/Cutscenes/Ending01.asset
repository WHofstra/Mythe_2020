  _sentences:
  - Why did you come here, mortal?
  - I came here to ask for a favor.
  - And what might that be?
  - The return of my wife, Eurydice, to the mortal realm.
  - What do you have to offer?
  - Orpheus starts to play a tune on his lyre in order to convince Hades to release
    Eurydice.
  - If you truly love her, you do not look her in the eyes...
  - ...not until you reach the mortal realm.
  - If that is what it takes to be with Eurydice again, so be it.
  - Godspeed, mortal.
